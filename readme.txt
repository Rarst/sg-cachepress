The SG Optimizer is designed to link WordPress with all SiteGround Performance services.

== Description ==

This plugin is designed to link WordPress with the SiteGround Performance services. It WILL NOT WORK on another hosting provider. The SG Optimizer plugin has few different parts handling speciffic performance optimizations:

= SuperCacher Config =

The main functionality of SuperCacher part of the plugin is to purge your dynamic cache whenever your content updates. For example, when you create a new post, someone comments your articles, etc. In addition to that, if you have a working Memcached service on your server, the plugin will allow you to easily configure and enable WordPress to use it.

There is public Purge function - sg_cachepress_purge_cache, which can be used by other plugins/themes. Example usage:

if (function_exists('sg_cachepress_purge_cache')) {
sg_cachepress_purge_cache();
}

WP-CLI command is now available: "wp sg purge" to clear the cache.

= HTTPS Config =

The HTTPS Config allows you to force SSL usage on your site. It will redirect your entire traffic over secure connections and will fix mixed content issues. A side benefit of switching on the HTTPS is the automatic use of the HTTP2 protocol and its performance benefits. 

= PHP Config =

This tool will allow you to check if your website is compatible with the recommended by SiteGround PHP version(7.0) and switch to it with a click. It is highly advisable to keep your WordPress running on the recommended PHP for best security and performance.

= Requirements =

In order to work correctly, this plugin requires that your server meets the following criteria:

* PHP 5.5
* SiteGround account
* If you're not hosted with SiteGround this plugin WILL NOT WORK  because it relies on a specific server configuration

== Installation ==

= Automatic Installation =

1. Go to Plugins -> Add New
1. Search for "SG CachePress"
1. Click on the Install button under the SG CachePress plugin
1. Once the plugin is installed, click on the Activate plugin link

1. Go to Plugins -> Installed Plugins and click the 'Activate' link under the WordPress SG CachePress listing


== Configuration ==

= Dynamic Cache Settings =

* Dynamic Cache ON/OFF - enable or disable the SiteGround Dynamic caching system
* AutoFlush Cache ON/OFF - automatically flush the Dynamic cache when you edit your content
* Purge Cache - Manually purge all cached data from the dynamic cache

= Exclude URLs From Dynamic Caching = 

This field allows you to exclude URLs from the cache. This means that if you need certain parts of your site to be completely dynamic, you need to add them into this list. Type in the last part of the URL that you want to be excluded. For example, if you type in 'url', then '/path/to/url/' will be excluded but '/path/to/' and '/path/to/url/else/' won't.
		
= Memcached Settings =
* Enable Memcached - Store in the server's memory (using Memcached) frequently executed queries to the database for a faster access on a later use.
